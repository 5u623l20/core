<p>OPNids 18.9.a is the initial "alpha" release of OPNids. 
Until there is a full stable release the upgrade process is not likely
seamless but can be attempted right here from the GUI by unlocking it below.</p>
<p> Another method is to import and reinstall using a new installation image,
which will retain your settings (selecting "Import Configuration"), then
reformat the disk and apply a clean system (selecting "Guided Installation").</p>
<p>You can also upgrade via console / SSH by using option 12 from the menu by
typing "18.9.b" when prompted.</p>
<p>Please backup your configuration, preview the new version via live image or
in a virtual machine. Create snapshots. If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnids.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance.</p>
